The code in the book presents example for Excel and SPSS. 

This page shows the code in R.

Motivation
------------
While competing in this [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/c/WhatDoYouKnow) 
competition, the baseline model used a linear mixed effects regression model 
(lmer). In my attempts to understand the lmer model, I had to go back to basics 
and refresh myself on simple linear regressions.

Clearly I still have to learn as I finished in 56th place out of 257
competitors.
